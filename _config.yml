description: "We All Live in Bhopal is a piece written by Sudhir Selvaraj for the Renegade Arts and Theatre Society about the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, also known as the Union Carbide Disaster. With it being 30 years since the events, the script is a way to engage audiences about this significant chapter in Indian history. These scenes invite us to explore topics such as environmental damage, the role of civil society and the issue of corporate responsibility through the medium of theatre."
