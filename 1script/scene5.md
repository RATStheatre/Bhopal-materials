# Scene 5: 
The title ‘Olympic Aspirations’ is projected onto the screen

**Sarah:**
My name is Sarah. I am an American citizen and I stand with the people of Bhopal working with the International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal. I am often questioned about why I care so much about Bhopal. After all, it happened before I was born. It happened on the other side of the world and has nothing to do with me. Right? WRONG!

Bhopal is something that should matter to everyone, no matter how old you are or where you come from. It should not be bound by “citizenship”. Corporate irresponsibility and neglect continues to happen across the world. We may not live in Bhopal, India but if we do not stand up for justice, pretty soon we will all live in Bhopal.

Each year I coordinate a protest outside the Annual General Meeting of The Dow Chemical Company in Midland, Michigan. We picket the premises as shareholders enter the meeting. Our signs read “25,000 dead and counting, “DOW clean up Bhopal” and “Justice for Bhopal”.

We obtain shares from shareholders, allowing us to attend the meeting as proxies. In the Midland Center hung a giant chalkboard asking us to answer questions such as “What are the biggest world challenges?” We took the liberty of writing “Bhopal” underneath that question. It was erased by the time we passed that way when the meeting was over.
The CEO of DOW, Andrew Liveris’ presentation was very focused on their new catchphrase of

Solutionism

**Sarah:**
Some quotes that I found particularly amusing were…

**Andrew Liveris:**
We are Dow. We are Solutionists.

**Sarah:**
And…

**Andrew Liveris:**
Dow does not simply operate all over the world; it is respected all over the world.

**Sarah:**
(Scoffs loudly)

**Andrew Liveris:**
Today, Dow is in the business of breakthroughs. We are in the business of solutions. This company is doing well, and profiting greatly in the process.

**Sarah:**
(From the Audience) During the Q and A, I asked - how can our company afford to sponsor the Olympics claiming to be sustainable and socially responsible, when we refuse to clean up Bhopal? Isn’t Union Carbide a wholly- owned subsidiary of ours? 

**Andrew Liveris:**
First of all, I want to point out how the fundamental facts are wrong in how you framed your question.  Dow never owned or operated Union Carbide at the time of the gas leak. According to the 1991 court case, the government of India was fully responsible for cleaning up Bhopal and this issue is in their hands. Your actions here are misguided and misdirected and you would best be served by flying to India and posing your question to Indian officials.

**Sarah:**
Massive protests took place surrounding Dows sponsorship of the Olympics in the UK, India, and the US. The Olympic Games Ethics Commissioner, Meredith Alexander, resigned on air over Dow’s sponsorship. A motion to terminate Dow’s Olympic sponsorship was only narrowly rejected in an 11-10 vote. This debacle made the Holmes list of the worst public relations crises of 2011. 

**Andrew Liveris:**
(Sarcastically) Did you have a question or do you just like the sound of your own voice?

**Sarah:**
Yes, here is my question. Despite all the positives Dow likes to mention about last year’s Olympic sponsorship, you cannot deny that the backlash from our sponsorship created a public relations fiasco?

**Andrew Liveris:**
The Olympics have been a resounding success for our company. We have benefited beyond our expectations from our sponsorship. We are committed to a sustainable Olympics. What we are doing is good for the people of the world and I’m not going to apologize for that.

Activists’ attempts to link us to Bhopal are misguided and misdirected. The Indian government owns the plant site and all cases regarding Union Carbide are closed. Go speak with the Indian government, as this is their problem. If I get asked this question again, I will not be responding.
