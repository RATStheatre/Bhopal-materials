# Scene 6: 
The title ‘Rabid Optimists’ is projected onto the screen

(Lights fade in on the Narrator)

**The Narrator:**
Often, historic events can fall victim to becoming a single story - One told over and over again ensuring that it becomes a single truth in public memory. Nigerian Novelist Chimamanda Adichie says that single stories create stereotypes, and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete. They create one dominant story. 
How stories are told, who tells them, when they’re told, how many stories are told are really dependent on power. (Pause)

What do you think? Are the Bhopal activists relentless crusaders for justice? Or is Dow Chemical a victim of the activists? Whichever side you are on, remember it is important to hear both stories. Hearing the many stories enables you to take a more informed position.

**Cast:**
Stories matter.

**Cast:**
Many stories matter.

**Cast:**
We hope our stories have made you more aware about what is happening in Bhopal and around the world.

**Cast:**
Stories have been used to dispossess and to malign. 

**Champadevi Shukla:**  
About the suffering we endured and how we chose to react to it, against all odds.

**Cast:**
But stories can also be used to empower and to humanize.

**Rashida Bee:**
That you don’t need to be famous, influential, or rich to stand for the right. Power is with us when we are “together”.

**Cast:**
Stories can break the dignity of a people but stories can also repair that broken dignity.

**Sarah:**
That people’s struggles around the world are not isolated but inter-connected.

**Cast:**
You ask us why we still fight.

**Satinath Sarangi:**
What makes us believe that after 30 years we will one day see justice?

**Cast:**
Justice will be served. We are optimists, rabid Optimists.

**Satinath Sarangi:**
Yes, I am a rabid optimist.

**Cast:**
For me, Every tree that continues to stand,
Every stream that continues to flow,

**Satinath Sarangi:**
Is an indication
That the battle
is not only on,
It is being won.

**Cast:**
Possibly you will tell me
about the nuclear arms race,

**Satinath Sarangi:**
And all I can tell you
is that
An unknown child
held my hand
with love.

**Cast:**
You will try to draw me
into the plateau of practical life
Tell me
that not only God but all the religious
and non-religious leaders
are dead.

**Satinath Sarangi:**
And all I can tell you
is that
across the forest lives a young man
who calls the earth
his mother.

**Cast:**
You will reason with me

**Cast:**
And I will talk nonsense like this.

**Cast:**
And because the difference between reason and poetry
is the difference between breathing and living life.

**Satinath Sarangi:**
I will read poems to you.
Poems full of optimism.
Poems full of dreams.
Maybe poems better than this one

(Lights out and one final loud drumbeat)
