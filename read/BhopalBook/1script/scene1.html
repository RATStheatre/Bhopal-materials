<p><em>The title ‘Where Were You?’ is projected onto the screen.</em></p>
<p>The play commences in darkness. The actors haphazardly scream a combination of phrases such as “run!”, “What is happening?” “Bhagh!”  and “Where is s/he?” Five drum beats are heard and on the final beat the lights slowly come on to reveal ‘The Narrator’</p>
<p><strong>The Narrator:</strong>
Where were you when you first heard about 9/11? When news reached you that Osama Bin Laden had finally been caught? How did it feel seeing what was unfolding in Mumbai during the terrorist attacks?  Where were you? Think about it.</p>
<p>(Narrator pauses for 5 seconds)</p>
<p>Continuous media coverage, emotional visuals and fiery political rhetoric have crafted a story in our collective memories. It makes us all believe that we know the whole picture but how much do we really know? More importantly, how much do we really want to know?</p>
<p>(Picks up many old looking newspapers and starts reading) </p>
<p>Some excerpts from the newspapers on December 4th, 1984 -Hundreds of people die from effects of toxic gases which leaked from a chemical factory near the central Indian city of Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. The accident happened in the early hours of this morning at the American-owned Union Carbide Pesticide Plant, 5 kilometres from Bhopal. </p>
<p>… a cloud of lethal white gas to float from the factory over Bhopal, a city that is home to more than 900,000 people.</p>
<p>… more than 20,000 people have required hospital treatment for symptoms including swollen eyes, frothing at the mouth and breathing difficulties. 
Thousands of dead cats, dogs, cows and birds litter the streets and the city&#39;s mortuaries are filling up fast.(Putting down the newspaper) </p>
<p>This is the worst industrial disaster humanity has ever witnessed.</p>
<p>(The narrator quizzes two or three members of the audience.)</p>
<p>Do you remember where you were the night of December 3rd 1984?  What were you doing?</p>
<p>(Following the question The Narrator exits. Enter Champadevi Shukla. The actress will use a head scarf or dupata)</p>
<p><strong>Champadevi Shukla:</strong>
I remember where I was. I was in Bhopal. I am Champadevi Shukla and I survived that night.  My family lived a peaceful and content life less than a kilometre away from the factory. We always knew that the factory emitted small amounts of gas every day. But that night, that night was different.
(Enter Rachna Dhingra wearing a pair of glasses and carrying a jute “activist” bag.)</p>
<p><strong>Rachna Dhingra:</strong>
I am Rachna Dhingra. I don’t exactly remember where I was or what I was doing when I heard what had happened. I know I was seven years old and living with my family in Delhi. I vaguely remember hearing about it over the radio. ItHonestly, I probably first heard about it when I was 14, twenty years after it sounded boring so I went back outside to play.</p>
<p>(Enter Satinath Sarangi wearing his trademark red turban)</p>
<p><strong>Sathinath Sarangi:</strong>
My name is Satinath Sarangi. I was doing research for my Ph.D. in a village called Papria, 150 kilometers away from Bhopal when I heard about it over the radio. Everything went silent for me. I had no words to describe what I felt. Hearing about the desperate need for volunteers, I arrived in Bhopal the very next day.</p>
<p>(Enter Sarah fidgeting with a scarf)</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> 
I am Sarah, an American born on the other side of the globe in a little town in South Dakota in the U.S. I wasn’t even born when the tragedy occurred. Honestly, I probably first heard about it when I was 14, twenty years after it happened.
(Sarah and Rachna Exit)</p>
<p><strong>Champadevi Shukla:</strong><br>Earlier that night, my sons returned from a film, complaining that their eyes were burning. I told them, “go to sleep. It would be all better in the morning” (Laughs quietly to herself).
In the middle of the night, I heard someone shouting “Bhaag! Bhaag!”. The room where all six members of my family slept was slowly filling with a white gas. Our eyes started burning and tearing; our noses and mouths started watering. We rushed out of our home, having no time to fully clothe ourselves, not even to put our slippers on!
We kept running  despite the immense pain. The pale moonlight felt like needles piercing our eyes. We knew that if we fell, we would be trampled and not get up again.
Satinath Sarangi
The magnitude of the disaster hit me only when I arrived the next day. Where do you start? What do you do? It was unfathomable. I was helpless. Just outside the railway station I was shocked to see dozens of people walking a few steps and then falling down. As I walked a little further, I saw people huddled in small groups. They just sat there; crying and groaning in misery.</p>
<p><strong>Champadevi Shukla:</strong><br>At the hospital, the scene was horrific. Doctors were perplexed because they had no idea what exactly had happened. They were unable to treat anyone because they were unsure about the composition of this strange white gas. Anyone who fell unconscious was added to a pile of dead bodies resembling sacks of wheat!</p>
<p><strong>Satinath Sarangi:</strong>
Communal graves had to be dug to bury the Muslims and truckloads of wood had to be brought from all over the region to cremate Hindus.</p>
<p><strong>Champadevi Shukla:</strong>
It wasn’t lucky that we survived that night. Those who died that night were the lucky ones</p>
<p>(Lights) (Five Loud Drum beats indicate the transition to the next scene)</p>
