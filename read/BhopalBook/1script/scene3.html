<p>The title ‘Official Communiqué: A Message from the CEO’ is projected onto the screen</p>
<p>(Slow fade onto The Narrator. He is meant to provide an introduction to the CEO as one would at an important event.)</p>
<p><strong>The Narrator:</strong>
On November 28th, 2002, shortly after the Dow Chemical Company completed its acquisition of Union Carbide, President and CEO of the Dow Chemical Company, Mr. Michael Parker wrote an open letter via Dow’ intranet to ALL employees. The letter was titled, “India 18 years ago”. Ladies and Gentleman, Mr. Michael Parker.</p>
<p>(Enter Michael Parker wearing a solid maroon or red tie. His hair is well- kept and slick - very corporate. Steps onto a raised platform.)</p>
<p><strong>Michael Parker:</strong>
Dear Colleagues, December 3rd marks the 18th anniversary of the terrible tragedy that occurred in Bhopal, India. It was a tragedy of unprecedented proportions, and no one in industry – especially the chemical industry – should ever forget. On December 3rd, I plan to spend a few quiet moments reflecting on the lessons of Bhopal and also personally recommit to achieving excellence in Dow’s environment, health and safety performance, and continuing our drive toward Sustainable Development. I encourage every Dow employee to do the same. Without a doubt, the tragedy changed our industry forever as companies across the globe collectively took on the moral responsibility to prevent anything like it from ever happening again.</p>
<p>(As each actor enters they should position themselves to effectively display the different worlds that these characters occupy)</p>
<p><strong>Rashida Bee:</strong>
Even today more than 20,000 tonnes of chemicals are mixed with the soil. They only highlight the small amount that they are storing safely. Both the Central and State governments claim that there is no toxic waste in the soil or water and protesters are lying about this.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Parker:</strong>
As you know, Dow acquired Union Carbide’s stock on February 6, 2001. And that is why, with the anniversary of the Bhopal tragedy approaching, it is very likely that Dow will be the focus of protests and demonstrations. To provide some balance to the claims you’ll likely hear from environmental groups over the coming weeks, I wanted to reiterate Dow’s perspective on this issue.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the highest courts of India, the Bhopal case is closed. In 1989 a settlement agreement was reached between Union Carbide, Union Carbide India Limited and the Indian government through which Union Carbide paid $470 million in compensation, covering all claims relating to the incident.</p>
<p><strong>Satinath Sarangi:</strong>
The amount was decided behind closed doors enabling Carbide to go Scott free. The compensation distribution was bad in design and worse in implementation. It is a perfect example of how things should not be done.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Parker:</strong>
The Indian Supreme Court reviewed this settlement agreement in 1991, and concluded that it was &#39;just, equitable and reasonable&#39;.</p>
<p><strong>Satinath Sarangi:</strong>
It is apparent that people genuinely believe that the value of an American life is higher than the value of other lives. Dow has accepted the liabilities of Union Carbide in the U.S. but not in India. When trying to explain about the meager compensation, Dow’s PR Chief replied, “$500 is plenty good for an Indian.”</p>
<p><strong>Michael Parker:</strong>
At that point the legal case was closed. So when Dow completed its acquisition of Union Carbide stock in February 2001, the subsidiary had no remaining liability for the tragedy that had occurred 16 years previously.</p>
<p><strong>Rashida Bee:</strong>
The Bhopal gas tragedy should be an example for companies all over the world. Dow should legally take responsibility for the mess created here. People should be given the right to live respectfully and be allowed to earn two meals a day with dignity.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Parker:</strong>
The black-and-white legal case is one thing. But, there is more for us to consider. We are a company committed to Sustainable Development, and therefore, the very notion of good corporate citizenship.</p>
<p>It is extremely likely we will face a number of protests at our sites around the world during the coming weeks, and into the future. I regret for this distraction – I realize it can be both disruptive and distressing – but I hope you can understand why we will not yield to this sort of pressure. I also hope you will not let this deter your pride in our company and all that it stands for. The products we produce benefit people around the world, improving their lives each and every day</p>
<p><strong>Rachna Dhingra:</strong>
The struggle of Bhopal is not just about the people of Bhopal we are all part of this ‘cycle of poison’. The same companies who manufacture the pesticides are the same ones who make the drugs to relieve you from the pesticides and yes, they are the same ones who make the genetically modified crops that we will soon be eating.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Parker:</strong>
So, on December 3rd, take a moment, to reflect on the tragedy of Bhopal, and to recommit to doing your part to moving our company ever closer to that vision of zero harm to the environment. Thank you for your continued support. Sincerely, Michael D. Parker, President and CEO of the Dow Chemical Company</p>
