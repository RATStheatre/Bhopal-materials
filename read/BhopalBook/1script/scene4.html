<p>The title ‘Campaigns’ is projected onto the screen</p>
<p><strong>Rachna Dhingra:</strong>
Rather long for Facebook but I wanted to thank all of you and share my thoughts</p>
<p>(Typing) Dear All,  As you may know the results of the 2014 election are available at the Election Commission’s website. As per the results for the Bhopal Parliamentary seat the BJP candidate Mr. Alok Sanjar votes won the seat defeating the congress candidate Mr. P C Sharma and I Rachna Dhingra stand at third place.</p>
<p>(looks up from the computer) Phew! It is ironic, really. I often think back to that 7 year old who didn&#39;t care enough about some announcement on the radio to even listen to it fully. I heard snatches of the news report, but went back to playing in the garden in Delhi.  At that point, I never would have thought then that what happened that night would have had such a profound impact on my life.</p>
<p>My participation in these elections is just another example of how I have been trying to bring about change in the system. In 1999, I was doing my undergrad degree in business from the University of Michigan when I saw activists from Bhopal protesting on campus. On talking to them, I found out that they were there to oppose the merger of Union Carbide and Dow Chemicals, saying that Dow could not accept just the assets of Union Carbide without accepting its liabilities. Bhopal, therefore, was Dow’s responsibility. Those activists made me realise how bad the situation was. I decided at that point to bring about change from the inside. But it was only when I was exposed to Dow as a client while working for Accenture after graduation that I found out how hopeless the situation actually was! I learned they would never respond to the environmental or human rights travesties in Bhopal. Corporations don’t have a mind or soul. Their bottom line is profit.</p>
<p>At that point, I turned my back on the opportunity of a life of comfort, quit my job, and came to Bhopal to join the movement.</p>
<p>(Sounds of knocking)</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong>
Rachna?  Hi, I am Sarah! We were supposed to meet today. I was the one emailing you about the work that we have been doing with the International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal.</p>
<p><strong>Rachna Dhingra:</strong>
Of course, I wasn&#39;t expecting you to come until the evening but don&#39;t worry, come in. I was just posting a thank you note on facebook for our supporters.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong>
I don&#39;t know how you do it, Rachna – manage to stand for elections in the midst of all the other work you are doing.</p>
<p><strong>Rachna Dhingra:</strong>
You study English Literature, right Sarah? I am sure you have heard of this poem by Maya Angelou called ‘Phenomenal Woman’.
“It’s the fire in my eyes, 
And the flash of my teeth, </p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong>
The swing in my waist, 
And the joy in my feet. </p>
<p><strong>Together:</strong>
I’m a woman 
Phenomenally.”</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong>
(smiling) It is one of my favourites.</p>
<p><strong>Rachna Dhingra:</strong>
I get my strength from the women in Bhopal. I have had a privileged life. But these women have been fighting for 30 years now. Together, we are fighting; ensuring that our stories are heard by as many people as possible. We do this so that no more Bhopals happen anywhere in the world. I will tell you a story that exemplifies this incredible strength of the women of Bhopal that I draw on whenever I feel that all is lost.</p>
<p>(Enter Champadevi Shukla and Rashida Bee)</p>
<p><strong>Champadevi Shukla:</strong><br>In the summer of 1989, Rashida Bee came up with the idea that we should go to tell the Prime Minister of our problems. He is supposed to represent us. He must be very busy and hasn’t been able to come see what happened yet. So we must go to him.  On June 1st, 1989, our group of 117 people started our ‘pad yatra’ where we would march from Bhopal to New Delhi.</p>
<p><strong>Rashida Bee:</strong><br>We walked close to 40 kilometres every day. When we got blisters on our feet, we treated it with herbs we found on the road. When our sandals wore out, we tied leaves to our feet and continued walking. We had taken food to last us for only one day and no more than 40 rupees in hand. The women sold their jewelry to be able to buy food and medicine for our children. We rested when we could, seeking shelter in the nights from anyone who offered it. In total, we walked close to 850 kilometers across 4 states in 33 days.</p>
<p><strong>Rachna Dhingra:</strong>
See Sarah, women have been especially affected by the exposure to this gas. It has had a bad effect on their endocrine and reproductive systems. Due to pressures that Indian society places on women they face trauma and mental health concerns that men do not have to contend with. They have to contend with questions such as</p>
<p><strong>Rashida Bee:</strong><br>‘Will I get married?’</p>
<p><strong>Champadevi Shukla:</strong><br>‘Can I have children?’ and</p>
<p><strong>Rashida Bee:</strong><br>‘Will they be healthy?’</p>
<p><strong>Rachna Dhingra:</strong>
Yet they came out on the streets and continue to do so; looking for justice not only for themselves but for movements around the world who are looking to them as role models.</p>
<p><strong>Rashida Bee:</strong><br>We finally reached Delhi. We waited near India Gate singing songs in protest against the injustice we were facing. We hoped to meet Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. We were told instead to meet the then Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh who was in Delhi. </p>
<p><strong>Champadevi Shukla:</strong><br>He told us to return home and he promised us our due rights. We should have written it down in paper, but we trusted him blindly. We never knew Chief Ministers lie too.
(Rashida and Champadevi Shukla exit)</p>
<p><strong>Rachna Dhingra:</strong>
In 2004, Rashida Bee and Champadevi Shukla were awarded the prestigious ‘Goldman Award’, Imagine it as the ‘Nobel Prize for the Environment’ in recognition of their sustained efforts as advocates for victims of the tragedy.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong>
I read about this… and they used their prize money to establish the Chingari Trust, right? For children born to parents exposed to the gas or the contaminated water.</p>
<p><strong>Rachna Dhingra:</strong>
Yeah. Do you know what ‘Chingari’ means in Hindi? It means ‘spark’. Sarah, women are the backbone of this movement. It is their example that makes me believe that a better world is not only possible but it is coming.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong>
I agree</p>
<p><strong>Rachna Dhingra:</strong>
Give me two minutes, I just need to finish off something. (Resumes typing) It was a roller coaster ride, the election campaign and I consider myself lucky that I had your support. Do let me know if you would like to know more about my campaign experience or any other aspect. Best Regards, Rachna Dhingra. And...post.</p>
