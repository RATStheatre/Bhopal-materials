<p>The title ‘A Proportionate Response’ is projected onto the screen</p>
<p>(A slow fade to reveal the Narrator, Sathyu and Rashida on stage in a very News Show type stage set-up. The sound of a news cast will start and visuals will reflect the same.)</p>
<p><strong>The Narrator (As News Anchor):</strong>
Good evening and welcome to a special edition of ‘Burden of Proof’. We are filming in front of a live studio audience in London. The airwaves are still buzzing with the unprecedented mandate that India&#39;s government has won this year. Not since Rajiv Gandhi in 1984, has a single party been voted in with an overwhelming, absolute majority. But 1984...there was something about that year. It was the first time an Indian went into space, and the year when 8000 Sikhs were brutally massacred due to gross police negligence. However, above all, it was the year of the Bhopal Gas tragedy. Today, thirty years later, we wanted to revisit what happened and what is the current state of affairs in Bhopal. 
We have with us, Sathinath Sarangi and Rashida Bee, two leading activists in the 30 year- long struggle for justice in Bhopal. In recognition of his work with the struggle, Sathyu was named the &#39;Man of the Year&#39; by The Week, one of India&#39;s leading magazines. 
With him is Rashida Bee, a survivor of the gas leak and a leading voice in the struggle, championing the rights of survivors and extensively advocating for women survivors. She was one of the recipients of the 2004 Goldman Prize. 
Thank you both for being with us tonight.
Rashida, I&#39;d like to bring you in first. And a very direct first question - Who do you think bears the greatest blame? </p>
<p><strong>Rashida Bee:</strong> 
The government! The government has been the biggest hindrance to the process of justice from the beginning. They have intentionally reduced the death toll; throwing dead bodies into the Betwa River, burning them, or simply hiding them.</p>
<p><strong>Satinath Sarangi:</strong>
A German toxicologist Max Dauderer arrived on the scene hours after the incident with Sodium Thiosulphate – a drug generally believed to bring relief to people exposed to cyanide.</p>
<p><strong>The Narrator:</strong>
Cyanide? So you mean to say that the gas that leaked from Union Carbide that night was cyanide?</p>
<p><strong>Satinath Sarangi:</strong>
Well, not exactly. The factory was actually built to produce a gas called MIC. The thing is that they hid the composition of this gas as a trade secret. It was only when the Indian Medical Council later proved that Sodium Thiosulphate actually helped that we realized that there HAD to be some cyanide in the gas. The antidote was initially endorsed by the Medical Director of Union Carbide. However, three days later, he reversed his recommendation in a press conference, flanked by Union Carbide lawyers</p>
<p><strong>The Narrator:</strong>
And how did you respond to that?</p>
<p><strong>Satinath Sarangi:</strong>
We still continued to administer it in the make-shift clinics we had set-up around the city, keeping meticulous notes about the positives of the sodium thiosulphate. One night,the police raided us taking with them all our records. That was the last time we saw them. This is just one of the many stories.</p>
<p><strong>The Narrator:</strong> 
According to a 1991 settlement, $470 million was paid to the victims. Shouldn&#39;t that be case closed?</p>
<p><strong>Rashida Bee:</strong>
The compensation that the government and courts have recognized is not justice. Where is the justice  when the person in-charge is still free? Where is the truth of the suffering we went through? Nobody speaks about the struggle victims and their relatives had to go through for even get this money. Bribes 
to doctors, no proper check-ups for 90% of the victims and nothing for children as they were minors. No compensation for women because it was calculated based on workman&#39;s compensation. Is this justice?</p>
<p><strong>The Narrator:</strong>
(a second of silence) Ok!  Moving on to the next question. Numerous reports state that illnesses and ailments are still experienced among new borns in the area. Is this because of the leak itself?</p>
<p><strong>Rashida Bee:</strong>
We see it all over our community. My friend Champadevi Shukla&#39;s granddaughter was born with deformed lips. Many children are born crippled or with cleft lips, missing palates or brain damage. And they are the lucky ones who have not gotten cancer. The water here is not clean enough for us to even wash our hands.</p>
<p><strong>Satinath Sarangi:</strong>
For three years prior to the leak, veteran journalist Rajkumar Keswani warned that the plant was unsafe and the management knew about it, but did nothing. The plant, running under massive losses, adopted cost- cutting strategies such as eliminating the cooling gas in the plant, halving the safety team and saving on transport cost by dumping their toxic waste in a site close by.  That night was just the culmination of neglect and utter irresponsibility.</p>
<p><strong>The Narrator:</strong>
Agreeing that more liability needs to be discussed, at this stage, Sathyu, who do we hold responsible? We know that there is no one person willing to stand up and take responsibility for this huge loss to humanity.</p>
<p><strong>Satinath Sarangi:</strong>
It has been impossible to extradite Warren Anderson. The US departments of State and Justice refuse to let him be tried in an Indian court! When he was arrested by the Bhopal police, he was taken to Carbide&#39;s luxury guest house under nominal &#39;house arrest&#39;. He had access to a telephone in his room which he used to extensively call-in favours from his friends in high places. The police released Anderson after three hours on the orders of the then Chief Secretary of the state of Madhya Pradesh. He was freed on a surety of $1,500, flown to Delhi in the Chief Minister&#39;s plane and subsequently to America.</p>
<p><strong>Rashida Bee:</strong>
Till today he remains in the U.S. and lives in his million dollar mansion in the Hamptons. He had connections that prevented his arrest then and he has connections now. Money helps.</p>
<p><strong>The Narrator:</strong>
I know this is unconventional for our show but there seems to be a very insistent member of our audience who wants to ask a question. Yes, Sir?</p>
<p><strong>The Narrator:</strong>
I just had a clarification so the Chief Minister knew about this whole thing? Who was it?</p>
<p><strong>Sathinath Sarangi:</strong>
Of course, Arjun Singh knew about it. In fact he was one of the first to know about it. He was informed what happened and was told to leave the city immediately.  In his memoirs Arjun Singh explains that he went to his old school in Allahabad where he sat in the chapel to and I quote, &quot;pray for the welfare of my people and gain moral courage.&quot; I find it difficult to fathom that a chief minister needed to go pray 550 kilometres away when citizens were dying left, right and centre in his capital!</p>
<p><strong>Rashida Bee:</strong>
The people&#39;s &quot;true leader&quot; was, in all probability, keeping his true distance from the people. That night angry protesters raised the slogan &quot;gas nikli adhi raat, Arjun bhaga ratoon raat&quot;. When translated this means &quot;gas leaked at midnight, Arjun ran away under the cover of darkness&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>The Narrator:</strong>
We have come to the end of tonight&#39;s show. Thirty years on it appears that the battle for justice in Bhopal is still on. As a small editorial note, I would like to urge all our viewers to continue to research more on this topic. Hear stories from all sides and then form your opinions. This is the whole way we can build a well- informed and active citizenry. Thank you, once again to our guests Rashida Bee and Sathinath Sarangi. Join us next week.</p>
